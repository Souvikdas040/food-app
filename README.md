# Backend (Spring Boot)
• Clone the repository.
• Set up MySQL database with necessary tables (refer to db.sql).
• Configure database connection details in application.properties file.
• Build and run the Spring Boot application using Maven or your IDE.

# Frontend (React.js)
• Navigate to the frontend directory.
• Install dependencies using npm install.
• Start the development server using npm start.

# API Endpoints
• Food Item Endpoints:
  ° /api/food/add: POST request to add a food item.
  ° /api/food/update: PUT request to update a food item.
  ° /api/food/delete/{id}: DELETE request to delete a food item.
  ° /api/food/all: GET request to get all food items.
  ° /api/food/search/{id}: GET request to search for a food item by ID.
  
• User Endpoints:
  ° /api/user/register: POST request to register a new user.
  ° /api/user/login: POST request to login a user.

# Database Structure
The database should have two tables:
• food_items (fid, fname, price)
• users (uid, uname, pass, nm)

# Additional Notes
• Implement proper error handling and validation.
• Consider using security measures for API endpoints.
• Optimize database queries for performance.
• Add more features like user roles, food categories, etc.

# Contributing
