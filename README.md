# Food App - README

# Overview
This project is a full-stack application for managing food items. The backend is built using Spring Boot and interacts with a MySQL database. The frontend is developed using React.js and Bootstrap for a user-friendly interface. Postman is used for API testing.

# Features
• Food Item Management:
  ° Add new food items with ID, name, and price.
  ° Update existing food item's name and price.
  ° Delete specific food items.
  ° View all food items in a table format.
  ° Search for food items by ID.
• User Authentication:
  ° User registration with username, password, and name.
  ° User login with username and password.
  ° Data validation for registration and login forms.

# Technologies Used
• Backend: Spring Boot, Java, MySQL
• Frontend: React.js, Bootstrap
• API Testing: Postman
• Database: MySQL

# Setup and Running
• Backend
  ° Clone the repository.
  ° Set up MySQL database with necessary tables (refer to db.sql).
  ° Configure database connection details in application.properties file.
  ° Build and run the Spring Boot application using Maven or your IDE.
• Frontend
  ° Navigate to the frontend directory.
  ° Install dependencies using npm install.
  ° Start the development server using npm start.

# API Endpoints
• Food Item Endpoints:
  ° /api/food/add: POST request to add a food item.
  ° /api/food/update: PUT request to update a food item.
  ° /api/food/delete/{id}: DELETE request to delete a food item.
  ° /api/food/all: GET request to get all food items.
  ° /api/food/search/{id}: GET request to search for a food item by ID.
• User Endpoints:
  ° /api/user/register: POST request to register a new user.
  ° /api/user/login: POST request to login a user.

# Database Structure
The database should have two tables:

• food_items (fid, fname, price)
• register (uid, uname, pass, nm)

# Additional Notes
• Implement proper error handling and validation.
• Consider using security measures for API endpoints.
• Optimize database queries for performance.
• Add more features like user roles, food categories, etc.
